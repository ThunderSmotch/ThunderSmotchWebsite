\chapter{Preliminaries}

Complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers. They arise from the need of having solutions to equations of the form 
\[ x^{2} + 1 = 0\ , \]
which have no solutions on the real numbers. We thus define the following number 
\[ i = \sqrt{ - 1}\ , \]
which is a solution to the above equation. As such we have that 
\( i^{2} = - 1 \).
